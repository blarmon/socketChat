# socketChat
This is the chatroomfrom the getting started section of socket.io's website.  I'm making several changes and additions, such as nickname support, and a backlog for messages so that everybody who connects can see every previous message.


features added by me:
 - nickname support
 - message backlog loaded when a user connects
 
 
 TODO:
 - show online users
 - validate nicknames (make sure two aren't the same)
 - display when a user is typing ('nickname is typing!', 'multiple users are typing!')
